Joanna has severe allergies that cause her face to become puffy and itchy around certain animals. Specifically, she mentions being allergic to most reptiles and furry animals. \n\nFrom the conversations, it is clear that Joanna has a particular interest in turtles, as she expresses a desire to have them but is unable to due to her allergies. However, she finds joy in watching Nate's turtles from a distance and appreciates their peaceful nature. \n\nGiven this information, the pets that would likely not cause discomfort to Joanna would be non-furry and non-reptilian animals. While turtles are reptiles and cause her allergies, she seems to enjoy their presence and finds them calming. Therefore, it can be inferred that she might be able to tolerate observing turtles from a distance, but owning them would not be feasible due to her allergies.\n\nIn conclusion, Joanna would likely be comfortable with pets that are not furry or reptiles, such as fish or possibly certain types of amphibians (like frogs), as these do not trigger her allergies. However, she has not explicitly mentioned any specific pets that would be suitable for her condition, indicating that she has not researched alternatives due to her reluctance and laziness in doing so.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\"Joanna would likely be comfortable with pets that are not furry or reptiles, such as fish or possibly certain types of amphibians, as these do not trigger her allergies.\""

This suggests that he may be experiencing stress-related health issues, which can manifest as anxiety or burnout.\n\n3. **Physical Activity**: John has contemplated starting an exercise routine, specifically mentioning the possibility of going for a morning run (17 March 2022). This indicates a recognition of the need for physical activity, which is often linked to mental health improvement. However, he has not reported any consistent physical activity, which could contribute to his overall stress and emotional state.\n\n4. **Social Connections**: John has expressed a desire to socialize more and balance work with enjoyment, indicating that he may be feeling isolated or disconnected at times. This social aspect is crucial for mental health, and his efforts to engage with friends and family suggest he is aware of the importance of these connections.\n\n5. **General Well-being**: John has also mentioned the importance of relaxation and taking breaks, which are essential for maintaining mental health. His engagement in gaming and organizing events with friends reflects a coping mechanism for his stress.\n\nBased on this analysis, John's suspected health problems appear to be primarily related to **stress and anxiety**, potentially exacerbated by a lack of physical activity and the pressures of balancing work and personal life.

The first mention of John's mobile game is on **20 September 2022**, where he shares that he has been working on the game for several months and is set to launch it next month (October 2022).\n2. Since he has been working on the game for several months leading up to September, we can estimate the start date. If we consider \"several months\" to mean approximately 3 to 5 months, we can calculate backwards from September 2022.\n\n- If we take 3 months back from September, that would place the start around **June 2022**.\n- If we take 5 months back, that would place the start around **April 2022**.\n\nGiven that John was actively engaged in various programming and gaming activities throughout March and April 2022, it is reasonable to conclude that he likely started working on his 2D Adventure mobile game in **April 2022**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\"John started working on his 2D Adventure mobile game in April 2022.\""
